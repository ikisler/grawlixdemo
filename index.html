		<p>Installing Grawlix was easy enough, easier than installing WordPress in my opinion.  I did have to switch to an older version of PHP, as it doesn't work with 7, so that's something to watch out for.  There was one other technical bug, but it was quite easy to fix.  (Click on the images for larger versions)</p>

		<p>Themes for Grawlix work similarly to WordPress -- there isn't a click and drag interface, and they would need to be coded from PHP, HTML and CSS.  Easiest way to do this would be to start from one of the base themes, and customize it from there.  Stick Figure is actually designed for this.</p>

		<p>Adding a new comic.  There is a 2MB file size limit for the image, so that's something to watch out for.  You can add a blog post at the bottom, but there aren't options like bolding words and so on.</p>
